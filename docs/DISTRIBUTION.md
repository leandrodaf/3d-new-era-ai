# Distribution

How 3D New Era AI reaches people: the ways to run it, the channels it is
published on, and what a release updates on its own.

## One tool surface, three places to run it

Every path calls the same `newera-mcp` crate: the same tools, the same
annotations and the same in-chat plan viewer. The AI client cannot tell them
apart.

```

- **Desktop:** `newera` serves MCP over HTTP on `127.0.0.1:7878/mcp`. `newera mcp`
  (stdio) attaches to the open window, or runs headless when there is none.
- **Browser editor:** `crates/newera-editor-web`, served at
  [3dneweraai.com/app](https://3dneweraai.com/app/). A tab can join the relay and
  give an AI client a URL of its own.
- **Hosted:** `crates/newera-cloud` mounts the relay (`crates/newera-relay`) and
  adds accounts, OAuth, cloud projects, a job queue for heavy renders, and
  billing. It exposes the same tools minus the ones that only make sense on the
  user's machine (`feedback`, `plugins`/`run_plugin`, and free file paths, which
  map to the account's own projects and 24-hour download links).

### Commitments

1. The desktop app and the browser editor are free, open source and need no
   account.
2. The cloud is optional. A cloud project is the same `.newera` file as on the
   desktop and can be downloaded at any time.
3. There is one tool surface. No channel gets a fork of `newera-mcp`.
4. Only what costs server time is paid. Anything that runs on the user's machine
   stays free.

### Directory rules the code keeps

These are enforced by tests in `crates/newera-mcp`, so a new tool that breaks
them fails CI:

- every tool has a `title` and correct `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint` and
  `openWorldHint` annotations (`every_tool_has_hints`);
- reads never change the document (`reads_change_nothing`), and a read refuses
  write arguments (`a_read_refuses_a_write_argument`);
- descriptions do not give orders to the model or advertise;
- errors say what to do next;
- hosted tools declare their OAuth scope in `securitySchemes`
  (`every_hosted_tool_asks_for_the_account`).

Inside an AI client nothing is sold: no prices, no upgrade buttons and no
checkout links in tool output. The free plan must be useful on its own.

## Release flow

1. Bump the version in `Cargo.toml`, then run `cargo update -w` and
   [`scripts/sync-version.sh`](../scripts/sync-version.sh), which carries it into
   `server.json`, the plugin manifests and `gemini-extension.json` (CI runs it with
   `--check`).
2. Add the `CHANGELOG.md` entry and its compare link.
3. Commit `Release X.Y.Z` and push a signed tag `vX.Y.Z`.

The tag triggers:

- `release.yml`: builds every platform, packs the `.mcpb`, publishes the GitHub
  release, the MCP Registry entry, the winget PR and the Homebrew cask;
- `deploy-vps.yml`: the `newera-cloud` image, rolled out with a health check.

The site and the browser editor (`publish.yml`, `pages.yml`) deploy from every
push to `main` that touches them.

## Hosted service

`newera-cloud` runs as a single container with Postgres. To run it locally with
its own database:

```sh
docker compose -f crates/newera-cloud/local/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

Sign-in links are printed to the log. Every setting is documented in
[`crates/newera-cloud/local/app.env.example`](../crates/newera-cloud/local/app.env.example).

Production runs on the maintainer's VPS. [`app.onboard`](../app.onboard) describes it
to the provisioning tool, which generates [`deploy/`](../deploy) and
[`.github/workflows/deploy-vps.yml`](../.github/workflows/deploy-vps.yml). Those files are
rewritten on every provisioning run, so change the manifest or the tool's templates rather
than editing them by hand.

- **Accounts:** our own account id; identity is a verified email (magic link or
  Google).
- **OAuth 2.1:** PKCE S256, client registration by CIMD and DCR, protected
  resource metadata (RFC 9728/8414), refresh rotation with reuse detection.
- **Quotas:** every account has a plan (`free` or `supporter`) and tools check
  quota, never "is this a paying user". Heavy renders go through a queue: one per
  account, at most one per free core.
- **Storage:** the whole `.newera` file in Postgres (`bytea`) behind a storage
  layer, so it can move to object storage without touching the tools.
- **Sandboxing:** project file reads are jailed (`newera_core::vfs::jail`); a
  project cannot read another project's files or the server's.

### Billing

The paid plan (Supporter, US$ 5 a month or US$ 48 a year) is sold through
[Paddle](https://www.paddle.com) as merchant of record, which handles tax,
receipts and refunds. The integration lives in
[`crates/newera-cloud/src/billing.rs`](../crates/newera-cloud/src/billing.rs):

- `GET /billing/checkout` opens Paddle.js checkout for the signed-in account,
  with the account id in `custom_data`;
- `POST /billing/paddle` receives `subscription.*` webhooks, verified with
  `Paddle-Signature` (HMAC-SHA256 of `ts:body`, 5-minute tolerance, several
  `h1` values accepted during secret rotation). `active` and `trialing` grant
  Supporter; `past_due`, `paused` and `canceled` return to free;
- `GET /billing/manage` opens the Paddle customer portal;
- deleting an account cancels its subscription at the end of the paid period.

Billing is off unless `PADDLE_CLIENT_TOKEN`, `PADDLE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`,
`PADDLE_PRICE_MONTHLY` and `PADDLE_PRICE_YEARLY` are all set. `PADDLE_API_KEY`
enables the portal and cancellation, and `PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox` points
everything at the Paddle sandbox. The end-to-end tests in
[`crates/newera-cloud/tests/flow.rs`](../crates/newera-cloud/tests/flow.rs) run
against a mock Paddle API.
