//! What each tool is called for people, and what it does to the world.
//!
//! An AI client shows the title where a person approves a call, and reads the
//! hints to decide how carefully to ask: a read runs without a prompt, a write
//! asks, a destructive write asks harder. The directories that list this
//! server (the Claude and `ChatGPT` ones) check that every tool says so, and that it
//! says so truthfully.
//!
//! One table, applied where the router is assembled, so every transport — the
//! window, `serve`, stdio, the relay in front of a browser tab, the hosted
//! service — hands out the same answer. A tool missing from it fails
//! `every_tool_has_hints`.
//!
//! The hints describe the worst any action of a tool can do: `edit_cameras`
//! stores a view, but it also deletes one, so it is a destructive write. Reads
//! live in tools of their own (`cameras` lists), so they never share a tool
//! with a change: a client runs a read without asking. A tool that only adds
//! (a wall, a piece, a copy) is a write that is not destructive.
