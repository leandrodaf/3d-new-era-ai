way it looks, or wall=<id> puts its back on a wall; layout lists pieces turned to face a wall as \

height) or h (drop). render_plan shows the plan to you, show_plan to the person. A project can hold \
several plan versions; tools act on the active one. Finishes are short strings: `#rrggbb` paint, a \
