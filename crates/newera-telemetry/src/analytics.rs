//! How many people open the app, and on what.
//!
//! One event per run — `app_open`, with the version, the operating system, the
//! architecture and the mode the app was started in. It rides the switch the
//! rest of this crate rides: off means nothing leaves.
//!
//! What is sent: an id drawn at random the first time and kept in the config
//! directory, the app version, the OS family, the architecture and the mode.
//! What is not: the project, its path, the plan, the MCP token, the machine's
//! name, the user's name. The id names an installation so two runs can be told
//! apart from two machines; it is not a person and it is thrown away with the
//! settings directory.
//!
//! The ping goes to the project's own endpoint on the site, which holds the
//! Google Analytics secret and forwards the count. That is why it goes there
//! rather than to Google directly: a secret baked into a binary only reaches
//! the builds CI makes, and then everyone who compiles the app themselves
//! counts for nothing. The installers post the same shape from the same
//! installation id, so an install and the first run are the same installation
//! in the count.
//!
//! A build to work on, and CI, stay out of the count.
