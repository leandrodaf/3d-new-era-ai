//! Wall joins: the floor outline of each wall, shaped by its neighbors.
//!
//! Walls meet at *nodes*. A node is where ends coincide, but also where ends
//! come close enough to have meant to (a corner left open), where a wall dies
//! against the body of another (a T) and where two walls cross (an X). The
//! crossed wall is cut at the node, so a junction in the middle of a wall
//! becomes the same problem as one at its ends.
//!
//! At a node the ends are sorted by angle, and each end's side edge is
//! extended until it meets the facing side edge of the next end around the
//! node. That single rule covers L corners (miter), straight continuations, T
//! and X junctions and free ends (square cap). What is left is the middle of
//! the junction: a wall running through the node covers it, and the ends
//! around it stop at its faces; where no wall runs through, every end reaches
//! the node point and they share the middle out between them.
//!
//! The result: walls never lie over each other and never leave a gap, even
//! when the coordinates are a few centimetres out — which is how they arrive
//! when they are written from a description rather than drawn with magnetism.
//! [`weld_ends`] moves such ends onto what they touch, so the model agrees
//! with the drawing.
