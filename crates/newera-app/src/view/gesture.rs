//! What the hands did this frame.
//!
//! A mouse and a trackpad send the same kind of event and mean opposite
//! things by it: a wheel clicks in *lines* and asks to zoom, two fingers
//! glide in *points* and ask to move the view. The machine tells them apart
//! by the unit it reports, so we read that and hand the rest of the window a
//! gesture instead of a scroll — pinch, glide, twist, notch.
