//! Work that takes long enough to be noticed, done off the drawing thread.
//!
//! Opening a home with a hundred textures, saving a bundle, exporting a model:
//! seconds of work that used to happen inside a click. The window stopped
//! painting, the system called it unresponsive, and someone with no patience
//! clicked again — on nothing, since those clicks piled up behind the work.
//!
//! So the work moves to a thread of its own and the window keeps painting: it
//! says what is happening, how far along it is when that can be known, how
//! long it has been going, and offers a way out. Only one job runs at a time
//! and while it does, the rest of the interface is out of reach — a home being
//! read is not a home to be edited — but the window is alive and answers.
//!
//! Giving up is two steps, because not all work can stop where it is: asking
//! sets a flag the work looks at between one file and the next, and if it does
//! not stop, leaving anyway hands it over to the background, where it finishes
//! into a result nobody reads.
//!
//! In the browser there are no threads here: the job runs in place, as the
//! photo render does, and the page waits.
